          <p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/23/welcome-to-copenhagen-the-city-where-cycling-is-king.html">Cycling</a> is a vital mode of transportation in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> and an influential feature of the geological structure of the city, often a <a href="https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/">tourist attraction</a>.The city offers a variety of essential cycling conditions such as saturated urban locations, short commutes, and flat land — along with an broad and thorough system of cycle tracks. This has led Copenhagen to the reputation as one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world. &nbsp;Every day 750 thousand miles are cycled in Copenhagen, with 62% of all citizens commuting to work, school or university by bicycle; &nbsp;almost as many people commute by bicycle in Copenhagen as those who bike &nbsp;to work in the whole U.S. Cycling is <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/cycling-health-benefits">healthier</a>, more <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01441647.2017.1340234">environmentally sustainable</a>, <a href="https://blog.mapmyrun.com/7-ways-cycling-daily-can-save-money/">cost effective</a>, and a more efficient way to get around than by public transit or personal car.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Roadside cycle tracks in Copenhagen are generally one-direction, with one cycle track on each side of the street moving the same direction as car traffic. Legally, the minimum width is approx. 5.5 feet, but in practice most cycle tracks are at least approx. 7.5 feet, and very busy stretches of cycle tracks can be made wider by density of traffic. Cycle tracks in Copenhagen are separated from car lanes by a stone curb and the sidewalk by another protruding curb. They are by and large of a uniform design, in order to give cyclists a good idea of what any particular route will look like. Where roadside parking is available cycle tracks run on the inside of the row of parked cars, between parking and the sidewalk, essentially using parked cars as a separation barrier between bicycles and vehicle traffic. As most cars are single occupancy, this also aids to prevent dooring accidents, as the driver exits the car on the opposite side of the cycle track.</p>

          <p><strong>Independent bikeways</strong></p>

          <p>A few spectacular bikeways are not adjacent to streets. Nørrebroruten is a dedicated bike route on an abandoned railway track and so has few road crossings. Cykelslangen or Bikesnake  is a “viaduct”, partly across and partly longitudinal above port basins. Therefore, both are among the rare bidirectional bikeways inside Copenhagen.</p>

          <p>The Cycle “SuperHighways” are a series of bike paths that connect Copenhagen to nearby suburbs. This initiative began in 2009 when both Copenhagen and the neighboring cities realized that building new infrastructure would allow commuters to bike into the city and create more sustainable transportation options. Since traffic planners believe it will be very difficult to raise the modal share substantially beyond the current 50% for its own residents, &nbsp;the city has begun targeting commuters entering the city from surrounding municipalities on trips in the 3–10 mile range, aiming to increase the number of bicycle commuters by 30% throughout the capital region. The project involves a 310 mi network of 26 named and signposted routes following a uniform standard with high maintenance and good services such as automatic air-pumps and prioritized snow removal. While international media has created some hyperbole around the concept, labelling the network as bicycle superhighways,] they are largely not grade separated. Rather the routes are regular cycle tracks receiving smaller targeted upgrades.

          <p>While installation of a new cycle track in the city decreases the number of accidents along the cycle track itself beyond the expected number of accidents, a study of newly installed bicycle tracks in Copenhagen actually showed, taking into account correction factors for crash trends, traffic volumes and regression-to-the-mean, that the number of accidents increased by 9% compared to the expected number of accidents without new cycle paths. There was a significant increase of accidents in intersections following the installation of cycle tracks at intersections. However, since the number of bicyclists increased by 18–20% following installation of the cycle tracks, individual accident rates actually dropped when bicycle infrastructure was added. Since its publication, the city has used the conclusions of the report to improve safety in intersections. Notable improvements include rebuilding dangerous intersections, pulling back stop lines for cars to improve visibility of cyclists, and expanding the use of bicycle traffic lights, to give pre-greens for cyclists. A cyclist will now on average cycle 4.4 million kilometres before being involved in a serious accident.</p>
