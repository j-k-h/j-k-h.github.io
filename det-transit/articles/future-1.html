        <div id="content" class="indent">
          <p>Although both of these cities are significantly larger than Detroit, they offer insight into what successful transit systems look like, especially when the government supports them adequately.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>Detroiters commute 91 percent of trips still being completed in <a href="https://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html">private cars</a>. According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markdlv/">Mark de la Vergne</a>, chief of mobility for the city of Detroit, does not believe that an elaborate subway/streetcar system will be the solution. Instead he believes the city should create a more extensive and more frequent bus system through the already existing SMART bus. He plans to accomplish this through fixed route transit. &nbsp;</p>

          <p class="pull">“This is not the sexiest answer that a lot of people in this city and region like to hear, but it starts with frequent bus service.”</p>
          <p>&nbsp;“This is not the sexiest answer that a lot of people in this city and region like to hear, but it starts with frequent bus service,” De La Vergne said. He found inspiration from the transit system in <a href="https://capmetro.org/">Austin, Texas</a> because “lots of people take the bus there”. And also in <a href="https://visitseattle.org/visitor-information/getting-around/">Seattle</a>, which is noticing “explosive growth,” is said to have an increasing amount of ridership on their bus system as well, &nbsp;he said everyone takes the bus because it is dependable.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>“Where it starts is frequent bus service,”De La Vergne explains. “You talk about reliability? The bus is gonna be there.” There will still be holes in transit service, but because a bus system takes money to work, until further financial support is provided, there will be less efficient and dependent services. Acknowledging those problems is prioritized by De La Vergne’s team.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>“How we fill the gaps so that it’s a mobility system and not just a collection of things is really what we’re trying to explore,” he said.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>“If we’re putting down buses that are running every 10 minutes, getting you downtown within 20 minutes, how are we building land use, whether it’s in the city or suburbs?”</p>

          <p><p class="pull">De La Vergne later admitted that the audience and panel at the recent M:bility conference in Dearborn likely wasn’t the demographic who would start riding the bus every day.</p> Instead, he said in part the focus is on new residents that may have moved to Detroit from other cities that have robust public transit riderships.</p></div>
