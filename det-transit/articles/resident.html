        <h1 class="title">One Resident's Story</h1>
        <div id="content" class="indent">
          <p>We spoke to Jane (named changed to protect privacy), a Detroit resident who rode the bus often and offered to share some of her experiences with us. They were eye-opening, not because they illustrated key friction points within Detroit’s transit system, but because she spoke of painful interactions and incidents that revealed deeper human issues.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Issues with safety</strong></p>
          <p>Jane describes a disturbing scene for young women riding the bus in Detroit. Constantly, she notes, she would speak to men who would say inappropriate things, get too close, and sometimes become aggressive or almost violent. Jane says that she tries to stay cordial and polite, but it's almost always taken advantage of.</p>

          <p class="pull">“It’s always about my age and how young I look. When they find out I’m not [young] they try even harder. Sleazy old guys tell me what positions they’d put me in, how tiny I am.”</p>

          <p>Often they offer her money to “just talk” despite obvious ulterior motives. She speaks of one time, after an hour and a half of waiting for the bus (see reliability below), two men who seemed to know each other harassed her while they waited. “I thought they were going to kidnap me,” she recalled. “I was so scared they were going to get off with me.”</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>Jane also references how common she witnesses crime or violence. Once, a fight between students continued onto the bus after beginning at a high school. There were hints of a potential weapon and the police were called.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>Despite consistent experiences like this, Jane says overall she feels somewhat safe on the bus. “There are cameras, so I'm not really worried about my safety, I'm pretty calm about that.” Perhaps it’s a byproduct of needing to look out for one’s self.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Issues with cleanliness</strong></p>
          <p>“Busses go through a lot in a day,” Jane tells us. “They take a beating.” She mentions that she’s noticed DDOT’s transition from cloth seats to plastic ones because they get so gross. “Don’t let it rain or get too hot, or it’s bacteria season.”</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>She speaks of seeing vomit on the bus.</p>

          <p class="pull">She’s seen partying bus-riders throw up in front of her, or the remnants of spit-up or puke dried and crusted because nobody cleaned it up.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Often, people will eat on the bus and not clean up after themselves, and DDOT employees don’t clean that up either. “Kids will make a mess with snacks, juice, chips.”&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Issues with reliability</strong></p>
          <p>Of course, Jane has her own reliability horror-stories, like most residents who take Detroit’s public transportation. She mentions allocating an hour to an hour and a half for a drive that should take only 10-15 minutes. Once, the bus was three hours late.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>Waiting for the bus is especially difficult because of the conditions that the bus stops are in. “Seats by bus stops are IMPORTANT. We need to sit down [when] it’s hot or cold or raining.” And with busses taking much longer than anticipated, not everyone can physically stand forever.&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="pull">“The hooded [stops] are usually dirty and spraypainted, lots of broken glass. And lots and lots of litter: there’s trash everywhere and it attracts rats and birds.”</p>

          <p>No wonder people don’t take the bus, Jane remarks, “you need to make it good if you want people to take interest.”</p>
