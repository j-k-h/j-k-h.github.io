      <h1>Detroit counts on tech to prep for the 2020 Census</h1>
      <h5>FEB. 6, GOVTECH.COM &nearr;</h5>
    </a>

    <p>The city of Detroit estimates that upwards of 27,000 households did not partake in the 2010 census, depriving the city of crucial funding opportunities. For 2020, Detroit plans to take a reinvented approach, one that unites data and
      technology.<br /><br />

      <b>Effects of this story</b><br /></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Grants Detroit a bigger slice of $675 billion in federal funding</li>
      <li>Could earn another congressional seat</li>
      <li>Plans to promote positive relationships throughout neighborhoods</li>
      <li>Gives the state/country a better understanding of Detroit</li>
      <li>Will likely develop an application(s) to improve Detroit for its citizens</li>
      <li>Requires all residents of Detroit to have an internet-connected smart device</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <br /><b>Who's affected?</b><br />
      All residents of Detroit (postively), city officials (positively)<br /><br />

    <h3>STEP 5:</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <b>Central consequence:</b><br />
      The US government does not have an accurate understanding of the demographics of Detroit which therefore deprives the city of funding and representation in congress.<br /><br />
      <b>The audience:</b><br />
      Most vaguely, the residents of Detroit. More specifically are residents living in areas that have little to no demographic information due to a lack of census information.<br /><br />
      <b>Some demographics based on the (inacurate) 2010 census:</b><br />
      Total population: 713,777.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Black or African American alone: 82.69%</li>
      <li>White alone: 10.61%</li>
      <li>American Indian and Alaska native alone: 0.37%</li>
      <li>Asian alone: 1.06%</li>
      <li>Two or more races: 2.23%</li>
      <li>etc..</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      <b>457,273 Detroiter's sampled (?):</b><br />
      Detroit residents are classified as primarily <u>"likely democratic" (95.61%)</u>. The median household income is <u>$27,838</u> which the Census Bureau considers "<u>low income.</u>" <u>84,571</u> citizens noted that they <u>had a computer,</u>
      but the majority (372,702) did not answer the question.
    </p><br />
    <h5>SOURCES: <a href="http://censusviewer.com/city/MI/Detroit" target="_blank">CENSUSVIEWER.COM &nearr;</a>, <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml?src=bkmk" target="_blank">FACTFINDER.CENSUS.GOV &nearr;</a></h5>
    <p>Detroiters are primarily African American citizens recovering from Detroit's bankruptcy claim in 2013. They continue to live in Detroit despite the overall population steadily declining. Pew Research Center estimates that as 2018, <u>95% of Americans own a cellphone.</u><br /><br />
    When focusing on Detroit households that did not complete the census, it's fairly spread out over all of Metro Detroit - however the riverfront and north-west areas seem to lack data a little more. The idea of studying the demographics of missed households is paradoxical in nature. Is it possible or fair to draw conclusions on people who didn't participate?</p><br />

    <p>The solution relies on actual Detroit natives and I think that's a solid route to take: “It’s the people who know the first names of their neighbors’,” Kovari said, “and what we’re doing now is figuring out the technology they need to report back to us.”</p><br />
