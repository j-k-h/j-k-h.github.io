  <h3>Why have a website?</h3>

  <p>Today more than ever, we need individuals rather than corporations to guide the web&rsquo;s future. The web is called the web because its vitality depends on just that&mdash;an interconnected web of individual nodes breathing life into a vast network. This web needs to actually work for people instead of being powered by a small handful of big corporations&mdash;like Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, and Google.</p>

  <p>Individuals can steer the web back to its original architecture simply by having a website. I think artists, in particular, could be instrumental in this space&mdash;showing the world where the web can go.</p>

  <p>Artists excel at creating worlds. They do this first for themselves and then, when they share their work, for others. Of course, world-building means creating everything&mdash;not only making things inside the world and also the surrounding world itself&mdash;the language, style, rules, and architecture.</p>

  <p>This is why websites are so important. They allow the author to create not only works (the &ldquo;objects&rdquo;) but also the world (the rooms, the arrangement of rooms, the architecture!). Ideally, the two would inform each other in a virtuous, self-perfecting loop. This can be incredibly nurturing to an artist&rsquo;s practice.</p>

  <p>To those creative people who say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a website,&rdquo; I ask: why not have a personal website that works strategically, in parallel to your other activities? How could a website complement what you already do rather than competing or repeating? How can you make it fun or thought-provoking or (insert desired feeling here) for you? How can the process of making and cultivating a website contribute to your approach?</p>

  <p>A website can be anything. It doesn&rsquo;t (and probably shouldn&rsquo;t) be an archive of your complete works. That&rsquo;s going to be dead the moment you publish. A website, or anything interactive, is inherently unfinished. It&rsquo;s imperfect&mdash;maybe sometimes it even has a few bugs. But that&rsquo;s the beauty of it. Websites are living, temporal spaces. What happens to websites after death, anyway?</p>
