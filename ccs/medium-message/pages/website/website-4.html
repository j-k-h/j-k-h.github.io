  <br /><p><b>Website as garden</b></p>
  <p>Fred Rogers said you can grow ideas in the garden of your mind. Sometimes, once they&rsquo;re little seedlings and can stand on their own, it helps to plant them outside, in a garden, next to the others.</p>

  <p>Gardens have their own ways each season. In the winter, not much might happen, and that&rsquo;s perfectly fine. You might spend the less active months journaling in your notebook: less output, more stirring around on input. You need both. Plants remind us that life is about balance.</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s nice to be outside working on your garden, just like it&rsquo;s nice to quietly sit with your ideas and place them onto separate pages.</p>

  <br /><p><b>Website as puddle</b></p>
  <p>A website could also be a puddle. A puddle is a temporary collection of rainwater. They usually appear after rainstorms. Like a storm, creating a website can happen in a burst. Sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to have a few bursts/storms of creating a website, since the zone can be so elusive. Some people even call rain &ldquo;computer weather.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There is also no state of &ldquo;completeness&rdquo; to a website, like a puddle, since they&rsquo;re ephemeral by nature. Sometimes they can be very big and reflective. Despite their temporal nature, I&rsquo;ve even seen some creatures thrive in puddles. Meanwhile, some smaller puddles may only last a day.</p>

  <p>Not everything, even the most beautiful puddle with its incredible reflective surface, needs to last long. If the world doesn&rsquo;t end tomorrow, there will be another storm. And where there&rsquo;s a hole, a puddle will appear again.</p>

  <p>Puddles evaporate slowly over time. It might be difficult, but I would love to see a website evaporate slowly, too.</p>

  <p>Website as thrown rock that&rsquo;s now falling deep into the ocean.</p>

  <p>Sometimes you don&rsquo;t want a website that you&rsquo;ll have to maintain. You have other things to do. Why not consider your website a beautiful rock with a unique shape which you spent hours finding, only to throw it into the water until it hits the ocean floor? You will never know when it hits the floor, and you won&rsquo;t care.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, rocks are plentiful and you can do this over and over again, if you like. You can throw as many websites as you want into the ocean. When an idea comes, find a rock and throw it.</p>
