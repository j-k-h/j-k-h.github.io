  <h3>What can a website be?</h3>
  <br /><p><b>Website as room</b></p>
  <p>In an age of information overload, a room is comforting because it&rsquo;s finite, often with a specific intended purpose.</p>

  <img src="../../src/img/website/web-1.jpg" />

  <p>Simultaneously, a room can be flexible: you can shift its contents or even include a temporary partition, depending on occasion. You can also position elements in spatial juxtaposition, or create entrances to adjacent rooms through links.</p>

  <p>In the early days of <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/">The Creative Independent</a>, we sometimes thought of TCI&rsquo;s website like a house next to a river. We considered the interviews the flowing water, as they were our house&rsquo;s nutrients and source of life. We would collect and drink from the water every day. But sometimes, depending on its nutrient makeup, the water would change our house. We&rsquo;d wake up to see a new door where a picture frame once was. Knowledge became the architect.</p>

  <p>Like any metaphor, it&rsquo;s not perfect. For better or worse, it&rsquo;s much more difficult to delete a building than a website.</p>

  <br /><p><b>Website as shelf</b></p>
  <p>Zooming into this room inside this house, we see a shelf. Maybe a shelf is easier to think about than a whole room. What does one put on a shelf? Books and objects from life? Sure, go ahead. Thankfully there&rsquo;s nothing too heavy on the shelf, or else it would break. A few small things will do, knowledge-containing or not. Plus, lighter things are easy to change out. Is a book or trinket &ldquo;so last year?&rdquo; Move it off the shelf! Consider what surprising juxtapositions you can make on your little shelf.</p>

  <br /><p><b>Website as plant</b></p>
  <p>Plants can&rsquo;t be rushed. They grow on their own. Your website can be the same way, as long as you pick the right soil, water it (but not too much), and provide adequate sunlight. Plant an idea seed one day and let it gradually grow.</p>

  <p>Maybe it will flower after a couple of years. Maybe the next year it&rsquo;ll bear fruit, if you&rsquo;re lucky. Fruit could be friends or admiration or money&mdash;success comes in many forms. But don&rsquo;t get too excited or set goals: that&rsquo;s not the idea here. Like I said, plants can&rsquo;t be rushed.</p>
