# Scroll to feed and back again

As technology has progressed, humans have defined and redefined the publication experience. Once hieroglyphs on clay tablets, now dynamic interfaces on Kindles and iPads, history has a way of repeating itself. The translation of papyrus scrolls to a “scrolling” webpage saw a similar evolution as well, proving that while we continue to innovate and upgrade, familiarity serves us well.

This microsite is an experiment of this concept, an exploration of how we read what we read. By investigating five different "content-heavy" channels and abstracting them to their most crucial elements, differences and similarities between each begin to reveal themselves. "Scroll" down to read five texts that challenge the form of their corresponding medium.
