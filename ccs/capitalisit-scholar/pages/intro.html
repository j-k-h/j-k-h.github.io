  <h5>STATEMENT OF INTENT:</h5>
  <p id="intro">This website explores my personal expenses as a student, designer, and consumer. It also explores the necessity of said expenses — what items did I buy from merely being a consumer and which ones did I need to be successful in art school? To organize and assess everything I've spent money on, I've created a point system. A high number <span class="score">100pts</span> means the product is necessary. A low number <span class="score">0pts</span> represents a product bought merely because I wanted it.<br /><br />

  The following are 10 products that only begin to explore this concept. I hope to discover a little more insight into my spending habits and what it costs to be an art student in a capitalist world.<br /><br></p>

  <h5>TARGET AUDIENCE:</h5>
  <p id="intro">In its vaguest sense this project targets consumers also living in a capitalist society. Most specifically it should resonate with other (art) students who are expected to purchase products and supplies to succeed in their environment.<br /><br />
