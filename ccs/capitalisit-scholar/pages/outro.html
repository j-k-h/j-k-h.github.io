  <p id="intro">10 products. $5k. Is this the price of scholarship?<br /><br />

  Not really. Products such as the backpack were hugely overpriced, the Airpods —which are included in this total— fall into a completely different category of personal consumerism.<br /><br />

  That said, I own a laptop that the school required I buy, I've bought many books (only one of which made it into the list) that have been mandatory to pass a class. There is a necessity of capitalist behavior at college, a price that many students will struggle to meet.<br /><br />

  So, if I've gathered anything from completing this project it's that there isn't really a clear answer at all. Some products are required in a school environment, some we buy merely because we want to. Either way, we're constantly spending and it's difficult to stop and evaluate said expenses.<br /><br /></p>
