# Capitalism in Scholarship — Post-Tuition Expenses & Personal Consumerism
This website explores my personal expenses as a student, designer, and consumer. It also explores the necessity of said expenses — what items did I buy from merely being a consumer and which ones did I need to be successful in art school? This project aims to illuminate the vast amount of consumerism within our society and specifically explores who I am as a customer. Viewers of the website should be able to put themselves in my shoes as a way to address their own consumerism and potentially re-evaluate their spending habits.

The site will organize various products I've bought in a variety of ways such as price, necessity, and time (chronologically).
