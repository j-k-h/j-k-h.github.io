  <h5>QUESTION 1:</h5>
  <h2>Do you think you're an ethical person?</h2>

  <div class="grid-wrap">
    <div class="tim img" style="height: 20rem;"><h4>TIM</h4></div>
    <div class="martin img"><h4>MARTIN</h4></div>
    <div class="mark img"><h4>MARK</h4></div>

    <div>
      <p>For the most part, yes. I think it depends on the situation and whether or not the ethics being broken benefit the greater good.</p><br />
      <h3 class="pullquote">"Kill thousands to save billions..."</h3>
      <p><i>What do you think your definition of ethics are?</i></p><br />
      <p>Moral guidelines, and staying within them. It's kind of like that one saying, kill thousands to save billions... not that I would. I don't know, I'm not saying there's always an exception, it's still a tough choice, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.</p><br />
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Yes I do. I think that I'm a person who has a very strong compass when it comes to how I treat people and how I don't treat people. That's a very important part of how I approach my daily life; [which] I think is informed by my experiences as a gay man, it's informed by how I've been treated as a gay person and the way I've seen my gay friends be treated. Or even just how personal it is to see how gay people in general are treated, and I think that informs - especially when it comes to my approach to my own privilege and stuff - I think that it informs that a lot.</p><br />
      <h3 class="pullquote">"[Ethics are] how I treat people and how I don't treat people."</h3>
      <p><i>What does discrimination mean in that context to you?</i></p><br />
      <p>It can range from anything from high school and everyone says &quot;the gay f-word&quot; and it's a very normal word to say, which is something that's relatively harmless to people who have experienced actual violence or threats or whatever.</p><br />
      <p><i>What do you think your definition of ethics are?</i></p><br />
      <p>It's like what you consider to be the sort of proper approach to things, whether it's how you act or how you think, and like what's right and what's wrong. I think it's informed by people who I agree with and who I look up to.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 class="pullquote">"I want to help, not hurt."</h3>
      <p>I believe so. I would hope so. I hope I come off as an ethical person to other people. I guess my standing on how to treat others and how I view the world &mdash; I want to help, not hurt. I'm a nice person, I guess. I follow a set of rules where I don't want to hurt anyone and I don't want anyone to hurt me. As long as we can make things work out we're good, without violence.</p><br />
      <p><i>What's your definition of ethics?</i></p><br />
      <p>Having a belief that fuels how you perceive situations. Trying to be helpful and not intentionally unaware of other people's situations in life, and I guess trying to be aware that you might have it pretty good, and other people have it way worse; being aware of that and being more empathetic about that.</p>
