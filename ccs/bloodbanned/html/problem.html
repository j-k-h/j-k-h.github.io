  <h2>The problem:</h2>
  <h6><a target="_blank" href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/"><i>Source:</i><br />The Red Cross (redcrossblood.org)</h6></a>
  <div class="c1">
    <p>When I first read the initial article (okay... the article title) I formed my own viewpoint almost instantly as we often do in a liberally opinionated society. I thought: &quot;of course you shouldn't forgo gay sex to give blood&quot; and further &quot;that's unfair. Why would the Red Cross enforce a rule that's so blatantly pointed towards my community?&quot; It was easy, especially then, to feel attacked as a part of a community that has been discriminated against for a very long time.</p><br />

    <div class="button-rich">
      <div class="button-rich--img"><img class="button-rich--img-overlay" src="../img/icon/stopwatch.svg"></div>
      <div class="button-rich--header">Every 2 seconds someone in the United States needs blood.</div>
      <div class="button-rich--text">Approximately 36,000 units of red blood cells are needed every day in the U.S.</div>
    </div>

    <p>But as a I continued into the article the complexity of the situation started to reveal itself: the danger of HIV in the gay community, the necessity for blood, the ethics of participating in a society... in the span of a few minutes I went from being certain of the stance I held to being completely lost.</p><br />

    <div class="button-rich">
      <div class="button-rich--img"><img class="button-rich--img-overlay" src="../img/icon/shot.svg"></div>
      <div class="button-rich--header">Blood and platelets cannot be manufactured, they must be donated.</div>
      <div class="button-rich--text">Red blood cells must be used within 42 days (or less).</div>
    </div>

    <p>On the one hand I felt that yes, there was discrimination at play here &mdash; a year long cooldown felt extreme. But in contrast, it was clear that the red cross had restrictions in place for a reason. Appiah's point that restrictions are often cold and hard also seemed pretty applicable to this situation too. But all-in-all I was pretty unsure. Which is why I thought I&rsquo;d ask some other people.</p><br />

    <div class="button-rich">
      <div class="button-rich--img"><img class="button-rich--img-overlay" src="../img/icon/person-group.svg"></div>
      <div class="button-rich--header">Less than 38% of the population is able to give blood or platelets.</div>
      <div class="button-rich--text">Only 7% of people in the U.S. are type O negative meaning it’s always in great demand and often in short supply.</div>
