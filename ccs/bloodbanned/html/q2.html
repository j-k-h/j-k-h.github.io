  <h5>QUESTION 2:</h5>
  <h2>Do you think the blood ban is discriminatory?</h2>

      <h3 class="pullquote">"You could be straight and still have HIV and still contract it from other heterosexual partners."</h3>
      <p>I do... I understand where it comes from but at the same time it's a very outdated and disproven belief, and so, yeah I find it discriminatory. The fact that they single out only men who have sex with other men but then they don't really do that - you could be straight and still have HIV and still contract it from other heterosexual partners, and somehow they dismiss that, and even if those heterosexual people who donate blood and get away with it, the blood still goes through a screening, so that way they're not just going to give it to anyone even if they're straight. So I feel like with homosexual men it shouldn't be that big of an issue either.</p><br />
      <p><i>Did the 44x fact (men who sleep with other men being 44x more likely to contract HIV) surprise you? Does it change your stance?</i></p><br />

      <p>A little, but at the same time, just knowing that the blood goes through a screening process and everything I feel like it shouldn't really matter per se if the person is responsible and they get tested regularly and they're always testing negative, then it shouldn't really affect them.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Yes I do. Well &mdash; I'm not super educated on the topic, but you kind of have to assume that it comes from a fear of diseases basically - sexually transmitted and blood transmitted diseases. And I think it comes from a fear that gay people, especially gay men, are promiscuous and &quot;dangerous&quot; with their sexuality, and because of that gay people are just like riddled with disease, especially with gay men.</p><br />
      <p><i>Does the 44x statistic change your mind?</i></p><br />
      <p>The problem is that I'm not educated on how easy it would be for them to screen for HIV or STDs in general... but I don't understand why that policy isn't just also applied to gay men. Like obviously there is a problem with donating blood if you have something like HIV, or AIDS, but I think gay men who don't should be able to donate just like anyone.</p>
      <h3 class="pullquote">"I think gay men who don't should be able to donate just like anyone."</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>To a certain extent. I believe how they're handling it is very irresponsible. They have such a high demand for blood, especially in my case, O Negative, and yet I'm unable to donate due to me being gay and me being sexually active. Last time I checked, I'm clean, so it's very frustrating for someone who has O Negative blood and that type is demanded so much, that I am unable to give even though I am in fact able to give blood.</p><br />
      <h3 class="pullquote">"It's very frustrating for someone who has O Negative blood."</h3>
      <p>It's definitely directed at gay and bisexual men, and I'm aware of the statistics but if they're in so high demand of our blood and blood in general, why are we not taking the proper precautions &mdash; I mean it seems like we already are considering we're testing people and we're making sure that the blood is in fact good to use: why aren't we applying that to gay and bisexual men? Just have a more strict testing process, if you're in such a high demand why not try hard[er] to get it. I don't understand why you're slapping on a rule and calling it good enough when you're losing so many potential donors.</p>
