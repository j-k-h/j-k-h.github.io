  <h5>QUESTION 3:</h5>
  <h2>Should you forgo gay sex to give blood?</h2>

  <div class="grid-wrap">
    <div class="tim-2 img" style="height: 20rem;"><h4>TIM</h4></div>

      <p>It's up to the individual honestly. I used to consider being celibate so that I could give blood, but as the years went on I noticed that it didn't really seem to matter - because I'm still going to be discredited either way, so you can't win. It's kind of hard to pin-point. There's just a lot of pushing and pulling coming from the whole situation; where I get why the ban is in place, but I still feel like it's outdated. Basically it bars the people who actually have a chance at giving blood just because of their lifestyle. Even without HIV there's still other diseases and stuff that can be passed through blood, so I feel like to just single out HIV is &mdash; HIV is bad, yes &mdash; but if they're going to do that they should be more strict in general.</p><br />

      <h3 class="pullquote">My answer is "I would not" and to them I would say "I can't make the decision for [you] but my personal advice would be to find another way to help."</h3>
      <p>I think that there's many different ways to help. Like, I'm a registered organ donor. I don't think you should have to give up your sexual life to do something like donating blood. My answer is "I would not" and to them I would say "I can't make the decision for them but my personal advice would be to find another way to help."</p>

      <p>[If a friend were to ask this] I would support them of course, if they feel so strongly to where 'this is very important to me, I need to give blood,' I support that. I hate that they would have to do that, because it seems very idiotic to not have a proper testing system within donating blood. The blood is being tested, why aren't you just applying that to everyone else. Why aren't you applying that to those who are &quot;more at risk&quot; of getting blood-transmitted diseases. It's just &mdash; I would support them. I want to donate blood, unfortunately how I am and how my life is right now, it just wouldn't be realistic for me. It wouldn't make sense for me to be 100% abstinent. Hopefully [the ban] will change soon.</p>
