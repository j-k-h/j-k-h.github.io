Logging in promotes a sense of responsibility

concept #1: some sort of print counter
on the printed sheet, show data like who its for, who printed it, what # print it is

- when you open the site it prompts: who needs help prompting the census, enter names, when you print it out

using tech savvy people as a vehicle to reach non-tech savvy people -> social media campaign, or SOMETHING that recruits the initial tech-savvy people.

facebook ads/instagram ads or instagram PAGE/twitter

how are people going to know that this site exists in the first place

Capture tech savvy people -> educate tech savvy people -> convince them to recruit non-tech savvy people

perhaps focus on the way in the library
