        <h1 class="title">Error Analysis</h1>
        <div id="content" class="indent">
          <p>DDOT’s major shortcoming is its failure to be a reliable public transit system. In interviews we conducted, multiple residents cited a complete lack of consistency in bus schedules.</p>
          <p class="pull">Reportedly, buses have been up to 3 hours late, with one resident mentioning waiting for an average of 40 to 90 minutes.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Additionally, DDOT’s routes are limited and aren’t changing to fit the demands of a changing city. Busses aren’t kept in good condition. Many times, the busses aren’t cleaned regularly, resulting in old food, trash, and even throw-up lasting in a bus for multiple days. Bus stops aren’t tended to either. Many stops in Detroit lack shelter of any kind, nevermind a bench. If they do, they often face blight resulting in dangerous debris such as broken glass or trash which attracts rats.</p>

          <p>Bus-ridership can be dangerous, especially for women and people of color. Although Detroit’s notorious <a href="https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/mi/detroit/crime">crime rate</a> isn’t as high as it once was, it’s still a serious problem for people who need to walk to the bus stop.</p>

          </p>
          <p>The SMART system is funded by suburban taxpayers, so when the majority voted to opt-out of service, it severely debilitated SMART’s routes. They rarely overlap with DDOT lines, and even if they do, a resident will have to pay for two separate bus passes (though this has recently changed). Thousands of lower-income <a href="https://detroitmi.gov/">Detroit</a>, <a href="https://hamtramck.us/">Hamtramck</a>, and <a href="https://highlandparkmi.gov/">Highland Park</a> residents (DHPH) are affected by this.</p>
