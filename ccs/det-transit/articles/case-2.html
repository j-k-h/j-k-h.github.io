It is the oldest and largest of the urban transit service providers in the Greater Toronto Area, with numerous connections to systems serving its surrounding communities.</p>

          <p>Founded as the Toronto Transportation Commission in 1921, the TTC owns and operates four rapid transit lines with 80 stations, over 200 bus routes, and 14 streetcar lines. <p class="pull">80 stations, over 200 bus routes, and 14 streetcar lines.</p>On an average weekday in 2019, 1.69 million passengers made 2.76 million unlinked trips on the TTC, with the number of trips about evenly divided between the subways (1.34 million) and buses and streetcars (1.34 million).The TTC also operates door-to-door <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratransit">paratransit</a> service for the elderly and disabled, known as Wheel-Trans.</p>

          <p><strong>TTC Payment - Presto Card</strong></p>
          <div class="inline-img">

          </div>
          <p>The <a href="https://www.prestocard.ca/en/">Presto card</a> is an electronic unified contactless smart card-based fare payment system for transit service throughout the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and Ottawa. The TTC also provides limited-use paper Presto tickets, mainly for occasional riders/tourists, which come in 1-ride, 2-ride and day pass options. Users present their Presto card or ticket on a Presto reader as they enter a TTC station or vehicle. Either their fare is automatically paid through stored money, or a pass or two-hour transfer is approved. Their card or ticket then acts as proof-of-payment to present to TTC staff such as fare inspectors, who carry hand-held devices to verify Presto fare payments, upon request. As of June 2018, Presto readers are available at the entrances of all subway stations and on all buses and streetcars.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>Unlike the Presto card, the <a href="https://www.prestocard.ca/en/about/presto-ticket">Presto ticket</a> can only be used on TTC services (subway and surface vehicles within the City of Toronto). They are not reloadable and cannot be used on any other transit service providers that use Presto, including the TTC's cross-boundary buses that operate within the City of Mississauga or York Region.</p>

          <p>The TTC connects with other transit systems of the Greater Toronto Area. <a href="https://www.gotransit.com/">GO Transit</a>, <a href="http://www.mississauga.ca/portal/miway">MiWay</a>, <a href="https://www.yrt.ca/en/index.aspx">York Region Transit</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_Rapid_Transit">Viva Rapid Transit</a>, <a href="https://www.brampton.ca/en/residents/transit/Pages/Home.aspx">Brampton Transit</a>, and <a href="https://www.durhamregiontransit.com/en/index.aspx">Durham Region Transit</a> are connected to the TTC via some of Toronto's subway stations, GO Transit's commuter rail stations, and other hubs like Toronto Pearson International Airport. In addition to Union Station, there are 6 other stations where the TTC subway network and GO Transit commuter rail lines intersect.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p><p class="pull">Some bus routes of the surrounding local transit agencies run on Toronto streets along with TTC buses, mainly to reach TTC subway stations.</p> Examples of this include York Region Transit (YRT) and Viva buses plying Yonge Street en route to Finch Bus Terminal and MiWay buses plying various streets in Etobicoke en route to Islington station. However, by law, other local transit agencies are prohibited from carrying passengers wholly within the City of Toronto. Therefore, YRT and MiWay buses can only drop off passengers inbound and pick up passengers outbound while within the boundaries of Toronto. As these systems have separate fares from the TTC, regional buses that use fare-paid TTC bus terminals at subway stations drop off passengers on-street outside the stations. Boarding is done inside the terminals, and riders pay the suburban transit fare upon entering buses.</p>

          <p><strong>TTC Safety Programs</strong></p>
          <div class="inline-img">

          </div>
          <p>Safety features provided by the TTC include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Request Stop:</strong> all passengers travelling alone on surface routes (9 pm â€“ 5 am, excluding streetcar routes) can ask the driver to stop at points between bus stops. The program started in 1991, due in part to the activities of serial rapist and killer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bernardo">Paul Bernardo</a>. On October 13, 2011, after many requests from the public and, finally, a letter by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT">LGBTQ</a> rights group Queer Ontario, &nbsp;the TTC announced that it would make the Request Stop Program available to all passengers in need; from 1991 to 2011, the program was only available to women.</li>
            <li><strong>Designated Waiting Areas (DWA):</strong> these are well-lit, have intercoms, are monitored by security cameras, and are near the location where the guard car stops.</li>
            <li><strong>Toronto Paramedics:</strong> stationed at key locations within the subway system during the morning and evening rush to assist with medical emergencies and provide a faster emergency response. This also reduces delays on the rapid transit system.</li>
            <li><strong>Underground Alert messages:</strong> displayed on the subway platform video screens to notify passengers about criminals.</li>
            <li><strong>ThisIsWhere initiative and SafeTTC mobile app:</strong> In September 2017, the TTC created an iOS and Android app called ThisIsWhere that allows users to report harassment and other personal safety incidents to the TTC.The name was later changed to <a href="https://www.ttc.ca/Riding_the_TTC/Safety_and_Security/Safe_TTC_app/index.jsp">"SafeTTC"</a> and launched on September 6, 2017.</li>
