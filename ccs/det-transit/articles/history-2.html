        <h1 class="title">The Decline</h1>
        <div id="content" class="indent">
          <p>The city would discontinue half of its 20 streetcar lines by 1949, relying heavily on <a href="http://www.detroittransithistory.info/Routes/BusRouteHistory.html">busses</a> instead (to Nolan’s delight). After the DSR purchased hundreds of them to run along streetcar routes, the rail system was made obsolete. In 1956, the last streetcar rolled down Woodward Avenue.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/dwight-d-eisenhower/">President Eisenhower’s</a> Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 would expedite a decrease in public transportation. It authorized the construction of more than 48,000 miles of interstate <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/interstate-highway-system">highway</a>, gutting cities, with whole neighborhoods (usually majority Black) torn down or isolated by huge interchanges. Later, it would superpower Detroit’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight">white flight</a>.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>Finally, in 1974, the <a href="https://detroitmi.gov/departments/detroit-department-transportation">Department of Street Railways</a> would become the Detroit Department of Transportation, or DDOT, signaling that Detroit’s days of streetcars were over for good.</p>
          <div class="inline-img">

          </div>
          <p>In a seemingly optimistic turn of events, <a href="https://detroitmi.gov/departments/detroit-department-transportation">President Gerald Ford</a> would promise $600 million in federal funds (about $2 billion today) for public transit during his presidential campaign. A Detroit subway system or mass-transit solution was once again possible. All to be connected by the <a href="https://www.thepeoplemover.com/">People Mover</a>. It would mediate transport between a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-1_(Michigan_highway)">Woodward</a> subway system, would go all the way to Pontiac: it would even utilize a flush light rail system that would’ve extended into the suburbs.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>It’s an important point to remember, because bitter locals, out-of-towners, writers parachuting into Detroit and others easily forget that the People Mover, which exists as a lonely and generally useless 2.9-mile fixed-route light rail system above downtown’s business district, was intended to be more.</p>

          <p class="pull">The inability to capitalize on the $600 million federal pledge is “arguably the most damaging decision to the Detroit region in the last 50 years,” so says Keith Schneider, a former director of the <a href="http://www.mlui.org/">Michigan Land Use Institute</a>.&nbsp;</p>
