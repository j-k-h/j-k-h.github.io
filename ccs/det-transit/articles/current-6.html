        <h1 class="title">Detroit's Walkability</h1>
        <div id="content" class="indent">
          <p><strong>Sidewalk Conditions</strong></p>
          <p>Lastly, but equally as vital, is that <a href="https://datadrivendetroit.org/blog/2011/11/30/the-walkability-factor/">Detroit’s walkability</a> is not often considered. When relying heavily on public transportation, the travel to and from a station, bus stop, etc. is equally as important. Arguably Detroit has the most broken-down, dangerous <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/detroit/changing-detroit-footpaths-are-vanishing-across-vast-empty-lands">sidewalks</a> in the state of Michigan. <p class="pull">Indeed, with over 4,500 miles of cement walkways city officials admit there are more sidewalks in need of repair than they can ever afford to fix.</p></p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>Over time, unsafe sidewalks have cost Detroit taxpayers a fortune. &nbsp;In 2013 alone, while the city cratered towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a>, it paid out nearly $6 million to men and women that suffered injuries.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>“The shoe got caught underneath the sidewalk, which pulled the whole sole off, making me fall down,” recalled a longtime Detroit resident. “I broke my arm, I busted my knee, I knocked out a front tooth.”</p>
          <div class="inline-img">
            <img src="../assets/img/current_sidewalk_edit.jpg" width="100%"/>
          </div>
          <p>The incident put her in the hospital, billed her $900 in out-of-pocket medical expenses and left her without mobility of her right arm for approximately a year. She sued the city for failing to keep the sidewalk maintained and received a $32,000 settlement. For decades under Michigan law, cities could be held liable for only certain defects that caused injuries: they had to measure at least two inches required proof that the defect had been that way for at least a month.</p>

            <br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Sidewalk Safety</strong></p>
          <div class="inline-img">
            <img src="../assets/img/current_buscrime_edit.jpg" width="100%"/>
          </div>
          <p>For many bus riders, fear of safety is a part of their trip, not just on the bus, but on their commute to and from the bus. <p class="pull">Living in a city that has a high crime rate leaves many residents hesitant to participate in public transportation.</p> With many citizens working late nights and early mornings, their safety is at risk as they attempt to arrive home from the bus everyday.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>A Detroit resident is worried for her son’s life who works the afternoon shift at the Meijer store near <a href="https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/eight-mile-road">Eight Mile</a> and Woodward, and he rides the Eight Mile bus home when his shift ends at 11 p.m. She said she instructs her son to not get off the bus at the appropriate stop in fear of his safety. She instructs him to continue riding the bus until the end of the route at the Eastpointe border.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>“He should be able to walk on his own from the bus stop home,” She says, “but I just don’t feel comfortable doing that. So I tell him, get off the bus, walk across the street to Eastpointe, and your dad’s house is three blocks up ... stay there until the morning and then come home. That’s just the reality.”</p>

          <p>Many Detroit Residents depend on the public transportation system as a means of commuting to <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2018/03/michigan_commuting_to_work_tim.html">work</a>, <a href="https://datadrivendetroit.org/files/SGN/Detroit%20School%20Commute%20Distances%20Report.pdf">school</a>, and family. Taking away their right to safe public transportation restricts them of job opportunity/stability, education, and connectivity.&nbsp;</p>
