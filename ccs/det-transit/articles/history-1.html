        <div id="content" class="indent">
          <p>In the early 20th century, Detroiters had a plethora of options to get around: they could take a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checker_Motors_Corporation">cab</a>, a <a href="https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/michigan-central-station">train</a>, <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/picture-gallery/news/local/michigan-history/2017/05/11/before-the-qline-detroits-streetcar-history/101573428/">streetcars</a>, or <a href="http://www.detroittransithistory.info/TheEarlyYears.html">horse-drawn vehicles</a>. Like any sprawling city, the landscape was walkable, and resources were never more than a 10-minute walk away.</p>

          <p>In 1920, Detroit voters would approve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Couzens">Mayor James Couzens'</a> 15 million dollar bond proposal to build and operate another, municipally-owned street railway system, expanding an already extensive public transportation service.</p>

          <p>In 1929, an attempt at manifesting a subway system would commence. It was supported by automakers but met fierce opposition from the homeowners’ organizations that also held the line against neighborhood <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_integration">racial integration</a>. One historian mentions the proposal garnered the most support in the black ghetto, where workers needed transit to reach their jobs.</p>

          </div>

          <p>Meanwhile, back in December of 1917, and prior to Couzens' election as mayor, the second of two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_in_metropolitan_Detroit">Detroit Rapid Transit</a> engineering studies had been completed. This second report, prepared by a consulting firm hired by the <a href="https://www.gwbhs.org/object/city-of-detroit-department-of-street-railways/">Department of Street Railways</a> (DSR) Commission, had recommended that a total of 65 miles of combined underground downtown subways with surface or elevated rail lines further out in the city, should be built to relieve downtown traffic congestion.</p>

          <p class="pull">The DSR recommended that a total of 65 miles of combined underground downtown <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/subway%20train">subways</a> with surface or elevated rail lines further out in the city, should be built to relieve downtown traffic congestion.</p>

          <p>The consultants recommended that the city should finance and build the system, and regulate the fares, while the privately-owned <a href="https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/detroit-united-railway">Detroit United Railway</a> (DUR) Company would operate it. The money generated by the system would be equally divided between the city and the DUR, with the city's share being used to pay off the debt. Eventually, the city could use its share to later acquire the DUR.</p>

          <div class="inline-img">
            <img src="../assets/img/history_streetcar2_edit.jpg" width="100%"/>
          </div>

          <p>The plan met the approval of the DSR Commission, and in October 1919 was finally submitted to the <a href="https://detroitmi.gov/government/city-council">Detroit Common Council</a>. Of course, Mayor Couzens, who had campaigned on a platform calling for the elimination of the DUR, vetoed it (he was opposed to a privately-owned rail system that would compete with the DSR). The Council attempted to override the Mayor's veto but failed by one vote. That single vote may have prevented Detroit from having a subway built as early as the 1920s.</p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p class="pull">When the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/great-depression-history">Great Depression</a> came in 1929, it would strike a blow to streetcar ridership. In part to stave off rising maintenance costs, the DSR began running buses more frequently. In the mid-1930s, DSR general manager <a href="https://freep.newspapers.com/clip/39858122/fred-a-nolan-obit/">Fred A. Nolan</a> launched an effort to convert the city’s streetcar system entirely to buses by 1953.</p>
          <p>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p>The late 30s would rebrand Detroit as the “<a href="https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/arsenal-democracy">Arsenal of Democracy</a>” which would, in turn, boost streetcar usage as the country aimed to conserve gasoline and rubber. By 1940, the DSR had 500 miles of track and feeder buses. &nbsp;Detroit had the best public transit system around.</p>
