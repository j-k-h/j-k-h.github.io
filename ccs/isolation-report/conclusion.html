    <h1>Results & Conclusions</h1>
    <p>After <span class="mono">15 intensive days</span> of data collection and honest, human sharing, we have reached the end of the Community Isolation Report.</p>

    <p>Participants anxiety level fluctuated per day, as expected. However, it seems as though people's individual wellbeing acted in a more personal realm than that of a collective — many did not share the same reaction when faced with harrowing news, or good news respectively. As the stock market rose and fell and a barrage of worrying headlines continued, participants did not react negatively to these inputs, if at all. It's possible that anxiety level responses just did not consider these external elements.</p>

    <p>The highest collective anxiety rating was only <span class="mono">3.5,</span> just half a point above <span class="mono">"feeling ok"</span> - although this was an average with outliers. On the final day of the report, participants clocked in a record-breaking low of only <span class="mono">2.7.</span> This is to say, there was not a ton of variation. This is generally a good sign - that despite challenging circumstances, people were able to keep their heads on straight.</p>

    <p>If you participated — thank you for taking a minute out of your day to share your feelings. If you're a reader, which you most definitely are if you've reached this page — thank you. Hopefully this collection of feelings offered comfort and a birds-eye view of the world gave you reassurance that while all of this is scary, the world keeps spinning. Be my guest and share this report with friends and family (some of you can say you're part of it). If you have closing thoughts and would like to speak to me about them, my contact information is in the footer of this website.</p>
    <p>This is the end of the Community Isolation Report. Stay safe out there.</p>
