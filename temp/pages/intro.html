  <p>This website explores my personal expenses as a student, designer, and consumer. It also explores the necessity of said expenses — what items did I buy from merely being a consumer and which ones did I need to be successful in art school? To organize and assess everything I've spent money on, I've created a point system. A high number of points means the product is necessary. A low number represents a product bought merely because I wanted it.</p><br /><br />

  <p>These are 25 products I’ve bought for school or for my own enjoyement. They vary in price, necessity, and scale.</p>
