Personal opinion matters a lot, talk about pressure/weight -> total spent (more obvious)

Are you getting ahead because you can afford it?

Concept on need vs. want and the fact that it's complex.
Don't try to answer a question - just ask one. 

Would you be an artist without these items? Comparison between annual salary of graphic designers and how much you're spending. Comparing two numbers - how much money made vs how much money spent.

Need vs. want on a scale. Show both? Need on one side and want on the other. Color code them? Colored bar for what I spent extra due to want. If it's something that you need then it should LOOK essential.

Make pictures monotone? Represents need vs. want. Need it - it's in color, something that you want it's monotone? Dreamlike? Less concrete. Appealing in a different way. Monotone to regular.
