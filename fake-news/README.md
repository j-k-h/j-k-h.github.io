# NewsGen v1.0
*The Microexperience (Interaction III)*

This project, inspired by [an article on OpenAI's controversial language algorithm](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614237/openai-released-its-fake-news-ai-gpt-2/?utm_source=digg), prompts a user to choose between a short series of conditionals in order to produce a custom headline that they can "post" to spread their fabricated story.

The article references the immense power OpenAI's software yields (it produces sentences much like a human would), and warns against ill-intentioned use-cases such as fake news. Although this is a legitimate concern, someone on the internet chimes back: “You don’t need AI to create fake news, people can easily do it :)”

This micro experience places the participant in the position of both the OpenAI software as well as an online baddie producing fake news. The user is confronted with an incredibly simple process (they must choose from only two buttons) and discovers (hopefully) that it is incredibly easy to create somewhat coherent clickbait. A physical artefact of their headline is produced and taped to the "the wall," mimicking a Facebook homepage. The custom article even comes along with a randomly generated source such as the New York Times, or Buzzfeed: adding just an additional touch of legitimacy to a completely illegitimate statement.
