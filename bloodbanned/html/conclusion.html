  <h1>SHOULD I FORGO GAY SEX TO GIVE BLOOD?</h1>
  <div class="c1">
    <p>Short answer? No. From what I heard at least, there seemed to be a pretty similar consensus from the three interviewees that for them personally, one shouldn&rsquo;t forgo their sexuality to give blood. Further, it seemed like they all agreed that yes, the blood ban was discriminatory. </p><br />

    <p>Not necessarily in the case of &ldquo;this is blatant homophobia&rdquo; but in the case of this could be improved. I think a lot of the responses from the people I talked to came from feeling attacked as a gay person, which is something that the current blood ban does - it&rsquo;s confrontational.</p><br />

    <p>So what&rsquo;s my conclusion? I think that the blood ban, although sensical, needs to be re-written. I think that the negative implications that plague the red cross could be rewritten to an idea that&rsquo;s more inclusive, that doesn&rsquo;t automatically assume that men who sleep with other men are &ldquo;dirty.&rdquo;</p><br />

    <p>Continue to the next page to rewrite the rule for yourself, I think it&rsquo;s important to explore a new solution for 2018.</p>
