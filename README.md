# Interaction Projects
This is a collection of websites I've coded for Interaction I @ the [College for Creative Studies.](https://www.collegeforcreativestudies.edu/)
## Projects I've done so far:
- **[Blood Banned](https://jkhdesign.github.io/bloodbanned/)** — Should I forgo gay sex to give blood? This site provides an analysis into that question, and what other gay guys feel the answer to it is.
- **[Project Solis](https://jkhdesign.github.io/solis/)** — What tools would the NASA women behind 1960s space race utilize? This website aims to provide a hypothetical hub of resources for the women who got a man into space.
