# Interaction Projects
A collection of websites created during my time at the [College for Creative Studies.](https://www.collegeforcreativestudies.edu/)
## Projects I've done so far:
- **[Blood Banned](https://jkhdesign.github.io/bloodbanned)** — Should I forgo gay sex to give blood? This site provides an analysis into that question, and what other gay guys feel the answer to it is. *Interaction I*
- **[Like My Post](https://jkhdesign.github.io/likemypost)** — This begins to question our values within social media by focusing on the anxiety that we face before posting. The site offers three different experiences depending on what platform you visit it on. This project is prompted by "a single moment." *Interaction II*
- **[Name Generator](https://jkhdesign.github.io/namegen)** — I couldn't come up with good Spotify playlist names so I made a program that generated them for me. *Just for fun*
