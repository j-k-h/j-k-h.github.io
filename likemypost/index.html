  opted to do a script like this instead of media queries so I could keep my code as organized as this possible. index.html just acts as a hub instead of where all three of the experiences live.

  it does however require the user to navigate back to index.html if they want to switch experiences, but in a true use-case that wouldn't happen(?)
